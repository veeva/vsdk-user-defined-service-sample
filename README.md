# Vault Java SDK Sample - vsdk-user-defined-service-sample

**Please see the [project wiki](https://gitlab.veevadev.com/veevavaultdevsupport/vsdk-user-defined-service-sample/-/wikis/home) for a detailed walkthrough**.

The **vsdk-user-defined-service-sample** project covers the creation and use of the user-defined services(UDS). 
User-defined services allow you to wrap reusable logic into a service that can be used by other Vault Java SDK code, such as triggers, actions, or user-defined classes.
User-defined services are stateless singletons whose methods, once exited, return their allocated memory to the maximum memory execution limit: only the method return value counts toward the memory limit. 

In this project, the user defined service ProductSearchUserDefinedService provides two methods: doesProductExist, reduceProductQuantity.
Using the debug log feature in Vault, we will see how memory usage used by these methods is decremented from the overall SDK extension memory usage when they exist.  



## How to import

Import the project as a Maven project. This will automatically pull in the required Vault Java SDK dependencies. 

For Intellij this is done by:
-	File -> Open -> Navigate to project folder -> Select the 'pom.xml' file -> Open as Project

For Eclipse this is done by:
-	File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects -> Navigate to project folder -> Select the 'pom.xml' file


## Setup

For this project, the custom trigger and necessary vault components are contained in the two separate vault packages (VPK). The VPKs are located in the project's **deploy-vpk** directory  and **need to be deployed to your vault** prior to debugging these use cases:

1.  Clone or download the sample Maven project [vSDK Translation Service Sample project](https://gitlab.veevadev.com/veevavaultdevsupport/vsdk-translation-service-sample) from Gitlab.
2.  Run through the [Getting Started](https://general.veevavault.dev/vault-sdk/getting-started/) guide to set up your development environment.
3.  Log in to your vault and navigate to **Admin > Deployment > Inbound Packages** and click **Import**:
4.  Locate and select the following file in your downloaded project file:

    > Vault components: **\deploy-vpk\code\vsdk-user-defined-service-sample-components.vpk** file.
 
5.  From the **Actions** menu (gear icon), select **Review & Deploy**. Vault displays a list of all components in the package.   
6.  Review the prompts to deploy the package. You will receive an email when vault completes the deployment.
7.  Repeat steps 3-6 for the vault code, select the package that matches your vault type:

    > Deploy code: Select the **\deploy-vpk\components\vsdk-user-defined-service-sample-code.vpk** file.
